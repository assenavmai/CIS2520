Compilation
************
In the gcc complier, cd to Lab3WhiteVanessa/. 
Then, type in make to compile.

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
Type in bin/lab3 to run the program.

It will then run main.c with testing in it.

***********************
Testing the program(s)
***********************
Stack created using Linked List implementation.
Used functions made in Lab 2.

Simply, I created an array and then made a Stack * value.
I used this value to create a stack.
    -Called all the functions made after creating this EMPTY stack
    -All the functions outputted that the stack was empty so it could not do anything
    -The length of the stack was 0, printed manually from the struct

I then proceeded to test for push. I used a for loop to add each element in the array to the top of the stack.
Then I printed the stack, using printList() from the List ADT.

Got the length of the stack: printed correctly.
Removed the top of the stack: printed correctly.
Tested the length again: it decremented.
Got the top of the stack: printed correctly.

If inserted bigger numbers, the functions worked correctly.

If inputed NULL into functions it will print out that the list is NULL or some functions won't compile with it.

Tested with rather larger negative numbers: everything outputted correctly.

Leaving parameters out of functions created in lab3.c will result in a compiler error. Or replaces the values for some functions to NULL (push).

tested when I peek() that the list still remains intact.
*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
When the array size is set to [1] and not initialized it will print a junk number when pushing - push(). Counts this as an element in the list so length = 1. After that though, reads stack as empty. - TEST CASE 3
