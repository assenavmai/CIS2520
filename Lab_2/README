************
Compilation
************
In the gcc complier, cd to Lab2WhiteVanessa/. 
Then, type in make to compile.

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
Type in bin/lab2 to run the program.

It will then run lab2main.c with testing in it.

***********************
Testing the program(s)
***********************
Simply, I created an array and then made a Node * value.
I used this value to create a list.
    -Called all the functions made after creating this EMPTY list
    -All the functions outputted that the list was empty so it could not do anything
    -getLength() reported the length of the list was 0

I then proceeded to test for addToFront. I used a for loop to add each element in the stack array to the front
Then I printed the list.

Got the length of the list: printed correctly.
Removed the head of the list: printed correctly.
Tested the length again: it decremented.
Got the head of the list: printed correctly.

If inserted bigger numbers, the functions worked correctly.

If inputed NULL into functions it will print out that the list is NULL or some functions won't compile with it.

tested with rather larger negative numbers: everything outputted correctly.

Leaving parameters out of functions created in lab2.c will result in a compiler error. Or replaces the values for some functions to NULL (addToFront).

tested when I getFront() that the list still remains intact.
*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
When the array size is set to [1] and not initialized it will print a junk number when adding to front. Counts this as an element in the list so length = 1. After that though, reads list as empty.
