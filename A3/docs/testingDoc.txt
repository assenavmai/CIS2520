__________________AVL

Tested all the main functions - create, remove, add, isInTree and destroy.
    All tests were successful - bstMain.c located in src
Tests for NULL in the functions and such.

____________________FILE

Tested fot the fucntion remove() and rename().
Also opendir() and readdir()

Everything worked perfectly, results happened smoothly. 


______________FILEMANAGER


    getPath()
An issue I had was when I was searching it would go over the bounds of the tree.
- FIXED add if statement to check if the left and right were null. 

    openDirectories()
        only can store one file per directory
            tried to change the way it was stored to the struct but failed. - not fixed

Everything else worked smoothly in the file manager.....MENU was taken from Assignment 2 so it was thourougly tested there.
